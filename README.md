# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Employee Salary Prediction App**!  
This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict employee salaries based on various features like experience, education, role, and more.

## 🔍 Overview

This is a data science project that includes:
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Deployment using **Streamlit**
- Large model handling with **Git LFS**

## 📊 Features

- Predict salary based on input parameters
- Trained model saved as `.pkl` file
- Deployed via Streamlit for public use
- Clean and customizable Python code

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- Algorithm Used: `Linear Regression` (or mention your algorithm here)
- Evaluation Metrics: `R² Score`, `MSE`, `MAE`
- Trained on real-world inspired employee dataset
